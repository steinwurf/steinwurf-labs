About
=====

This repository contains some basic Network Coding simulations based on the
kodo library.

Build
=====

To configure the examples run:
::
  ./waf configure --bundle=ALL --bundle-path=~/dev/bundled_dependencies/

This will configure the project and download all the dependencies needed.

The "--bundle-path" option specifies where to download the
dependencies (the kodo library + others). If you do not specify a bundle-path
the default will be within a folder within the project directory called
"bundle_dependencies".

The "--bundle" says which dependencies should be downloaded automatically. If
you do not want to use e.g. the kodo library from the repository you may write
"--bundle=ALL,-kodo" and then specify the path to the kodo library you wish to
use by writing "--kodo-path=/home/xyz/kodo-lib".

After configure run the following command to build:
::
  ./waf

Run
===

After building you may e.g. the relay_simulations build typing:
::
  ./build/linux/relay_simulations/relay_simulations
