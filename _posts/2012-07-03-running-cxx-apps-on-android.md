In Steinwurf we like automated tests, first step to successfully implementing this is to run be able to build and deploy via the command line. In this [document](https://github.com/steinwurf/steinwurf-labs/blob/master/docs/android-c-application.rst) we describe the steps needed in order to execute an C/C++ application on an Android device using only the command line.

If you have any comments do not hesitate to fork/create an issue and contribute to the document.
