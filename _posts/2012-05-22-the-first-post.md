This is the first post blog post on the Steinwurf Labs page. In the future we will write about news that could be interesting for Network Coding researchers.

If you want to write about some research that is based or related to some of our software we would be happy to post it on this blog. Send an [email](mailto:labs-blog@steinwurf.com) or fork this repository and make a pull request.

This page is generated with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and thus blog posts are marked up using Markdown, take a look at the [markdown basics](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You can also use Textile instead of Markdown.
